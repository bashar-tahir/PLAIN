# PLAIN Estimation Architecture

This repository contains the code for the com**p**ressed decoup**l**ed estim**a**tion and **i**nput-based fusio**n** (PLAIN) architecture, aiming for scalable and flexible parameter estimation in the context of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). 

The work is currently available as a preprint here: [PLAIN: Scalable Estimation Architecture for Integrated Sensing and Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21242).

## Getting Started
Get started by running the ```main.m``` file. This executes an OFDM-based example scenario demonstrating the usage of the ```PLAIN``` class for angle-delay-Doppler estimation.
